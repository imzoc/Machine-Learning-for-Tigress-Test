Tigress Test program "tigress_test2.exe" runs tests of Tigress transformations 
that are described in a test cases JSON file and outputs results to a 
results JSON file and brief results to the console.

Dependencies:
"dune" build manager
"Yojson" library
"Re" (regular expression) library
"Atdgen" tool and library
"Core_kernel" library
"Logs" library
"Sha" (Sha- 1/256/512 hashes) library
"ppx_deriving" OCaml "preprocessor extension"
(and ocaml 4.13.1 and opam)

Install
=======

INSTALL the dependencies using opam as follows:
opam install dune
opam install yojson
opam install atdgen
opam install re
opam install core_kernel
opam install logs
opam install sha
opam install ppx_deriving

Build
=====

BUILD the project with the command:
dune build

Dune produces executables that have the extension ".exe" even on when not
building for Windows.  (But, of course, the filename can be changed.)  It puts the executable file in the directory "_build/default".

There is a sample config file provided and there are two sample test cases
files.

Run
===

RUN the Tigress Test program with a command like the following:
TIGRESS_TEST_HOME="/home/user" _build/default/tigress_test2.exe run script_01.json

The results are output to a file named: results_script_01_<seconds_since_epoch>.json. It contains the result and a duplicate of the test case information, which would be used in a future version to reproduce the test.
